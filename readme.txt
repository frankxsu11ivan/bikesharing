Deliverable 2
New York City Citi Bike Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to use data from New York Bike program and mirror it to Iowa.
To complete the analysis panadas library were used to clean up NY data. The inference of behavior cycles for 
New York's data is the visualization used for Tableau. The data pulled is for August 20219

Story Questions:
1. What hour are bikes used the most?
2. What is the checkout time (duration) for bikes?
3. How many users /rides in August?
4. What are the max start /stop times during the week?
5. Who are the users?
6. what are the lightest days of riding?

Graphic Results:
1. Through the graphics the bikes were used the longest in the August data at 5:00pm.

5. Through Untitled 1 and Untitled 2 the users are broken out. Males are the most frequent users with the August NY 2019 data. I like the "untitled" title as the heat map reminded me of abstract artwork.

6. through the graphics of untitled 3 the interesting anomaly noticed is that across the data Wednesday is the lightest day for bike riding. there are simiilar trips between male and female. Unknown are -as always - unknown.
